						<details id="details1" onclick="closeOtherDetails('details1')">
							<summary>1. What do you mean by a “thread” in Java programming?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>A thread in Java refers to a lightweight subprocess that is a part of a larger
									process. Threads allow concurrent execution of tasks within a single program,
									enabling better utilization of CPU resources and improved responsiveness.</p>
							</div>
						</details></br>

						<details id="details1" onclick="closeOtherDetails('details1')">
							<summary>2. What are some fundamental advantages of multithreading in Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Some advantages of multithreading in Java include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Improved responsiveness: Allows programs to remain interactive during
										long-running tasks.</li>
									<li>Resource sharing: Threads can share resources like memory, reducing
										overhead.</li>
									<li>Efficient utilization of CPU: Allows concurrent execution of tasks,
										maximizing CPU usage.</li>
									<li>Modular and simpler code: Threads enable modular design for complex tasks.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</details></br>

						<details id="details1" onclick="closeOtherDetails('details1')">
							<summary>3. What is the basic difference between a process and a thread?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>A process is an independent program that runs in its own memory space and is
									managed by the operating system. A thread, on the other hand, is a lightweight
									unit of a process and shares the process's memory and resources.</p>
							</div>
						</details></br>

						<details id="details1" onclick="closeOtherDetails('details1')">
							<summary>4. What is inter-thread communication for threads?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>Inter-thread communication refers to mechanisms used by threads to synchronize
									their actions or exchange data. It allows threads to coordinate and cooperate
									towards completing a task efficiently.</p>
							</div>
						</details></br>

						<details id="details1" onclick="closeOtherDetails('details1')">
							<summary>5. What are some functions that are used for inter-thread communication in
								Java?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>In Java, inter-thread communication can be achieved using methods such as
									<code>wait()</code>, <code>notify()</code>, and <code>notifyAll()</code> from
									the <code>Object</code> class. These methods are used to manage thread
									synchronization and data sharing.
								</p>
							</div>
						</details></br>

						<details id="details1" onclick="closeOtherDetails('details1')">
							<summary>6. What do you understand by the wait() function?</summary>
							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>The <code>wait()</code> function in Java is used for inter-thread communication.
									It causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes
									<code>notify()</code> or <code>notifyAll()</code> methods for the same object,

							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p style="text-align:justify;">A multitasking operating system is an operating
									system
									that gives you the perception of 2 or more tasks/jobs/processes running at
									the same
									time. It does this by dividing system resources amongst these
									tasks/jobs/processes
									and switching between the tasks/jobs/processes while they are executing over
									and
									over again. Usually, the CPU processes only one task at a time but the
									switching is
									so fast that it looks like the CPU is executing multiple processes at a
									time. They
									can support either preemptive multitasking, where the OS provides time to
									applications (virtually all modern OS), or cooperative multitasking, where
									the OS
									waits for the program to give back control (Windows 3.x, Mac OS 9, and
									earlier),
									leading to hangs and crashes. Also known as Timesharing, multitasking is a
									logical
									extension of multiprogramming.</p>

									If you are calling run() method directly, then you are not making use of the

								<p>
									newSingleThreadedExecutor: This method returns an Executor with single

							<div class="toggle-content">
								<p>BlockingQueue is special type of queue which is used when producer threads
									produce
									object and consumer threads consume object.
								</p>
								<p>
									Producer thread keeps inserting objects in the queue unless it is full and
									once it
									is full, it will be blocked unless consumer threads start consuming.
								</p>
								<p>
									Similarly, consumer thread keep consuming objects until it is empty. Once it
									is
									empty, it will be blocked unless producer threads start producing.
								</p>
								<p>
									Here are two important methods of BlockingQueue.
									put(): This method to put objects in queue until queue is full and waits for
									consumer thread to take object after that.
								</p>
								<p>
									take(): This method is used to take objects from the queue until it becomes
									empty.
									Once it is empty, it waits for producer threads to start producing the
									objects and
									put into the queue.</p>
